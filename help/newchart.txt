NEW CHART PAGE

This  page is mostly self explanatory. The default values for Latitude, Longitude,
and Time Zone Correction are set for the USA. Just check the correct radio buttons for other parts of the world.


Recent button: displays recently used location for one-click selection.

Find button: attempt to get latitude and longitude from an online database, and time zone information for
dates on or after 1/1/1970.

Select button: allows you to specify the set of chart options to use for this chart.

Temporary button: opens the Chart Options and allows the creation of a temporary options file for this chart.

The Calculate button: validate the data entered on the page and either: 
   (1) Calculate, display, and save a chart based on the data. 
   (2) Displaying the first data entry error in red at the bottom of the page.
   
Clear button: clears the page so you can start over (helpful if you really mess up data entry, as I often do).

Help button: displays this document. 

Back button: returns to the opening screen.
