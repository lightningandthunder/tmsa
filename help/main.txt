AUTHOR'S NOTE

This program is built with Python 3.9 but can probably be built with Python 3.6 - 3.8 (no guarantees). If you want to play with 
the source code, you will need to install Python (https://www.python.org/), version 3.9 strongly preferred. Note: some of the
libraries I use do not yet work with Python 3.10. Source code is available as separate download.
