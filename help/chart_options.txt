CHART OPTIONS PAGE

The Chart Options page allows you to load, edit and change option sets. The Default Natal options will be preloaded.

Load button: opens a file dialog and opens the different option set selected.

Save button: saves the option set and return to the opening page. First change the name of the option set in the 
text box if you wish to create a new set.

Help button: displays this document. 

Back button: returns to the opening page without saving.

The options available are:

Eris (on by default)

Sedna (off by default)

Moon's Node: don't use (default), mean node, true node.

Vertex (off by default)

Either of two models for the location of the background may be chosen -- 
Background centered on the cadent cusps (normal for natal charts).
Background centered on the middle of the quadrant (normal for ingress charts).

You may choose to not indicate background planets in the print out (check Don't Mark).

For conjunctions, oppositions, squares, octiles (semi-squares and sesqui-squares), trines, sextiles, 
and inconjuncts (semi-sextiles and quincunxes), the maximum orb may be set for ecliptic aspects for each
class of aspects: 1 (close), 2 (moderate), or 3 (wide). 

To not use an a particular aspect of certain class, leave that box blank.

For conjunctions, oppositions, squares, and octiles you may choose the orbs for mundane aspects (measured in 
prime vertical longitude) as well.

You may also choose orbs for the foreground both for major angles and minor angles in simlar fashion.

Inconsistent orb choices will be rejected (example setting class 1 conjuctions to 5 degrees and class 2 to only 3 degrees).

Aspects offer three choices: All, at least 1 foregroung planet, 2 foreground planet. There is an 
option to always list partile aspects (1 degree or less separation from exact) -- this is ignored if
"all" is selected. 

Midpoint button: opens the midpoint options page.
