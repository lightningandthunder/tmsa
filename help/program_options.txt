PROGRAM OPIONS PAGE

The Program Options page has two parts: Color Options and Data Entry Options.

In the Color Options section, the Choose buttons open a color picker control which will allow you to
choose a background, button, text, or error color. You can also enter a color in the text box by name
(for example "red") or by hex code (for example #ff0000). Case is ignored but you must include the # sign.

When you have the color scheme you want, click the Save button in this section. 
An overwrite confirmation dialog will appear.
