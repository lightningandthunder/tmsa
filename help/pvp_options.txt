Prime Vertical Parans are aspects between a planet closely on the prime vertical 
(i.e. closely on Vertex or Antivertex), and a planet that is either also on the
prime vertical, or is on the horizon or meridian.
Aspects between planets on the prime vertical are measured in azimuth; these are
conjunctions if both planets are on Vertex or both on Antivertex, and these are
oppositions if one is on Vertex and the other is on Antivertex.
Aspects between a planet on Vertex or Antivertex and one on the meridian are
squares that are also measured in azimuth.
Aspects between a planet on Vertex or Antivertex and one on the horizon are 
squares that are measured in meridian longitude.

You can set maximum orbs for these aspects in 3 classes. Omit a class boundary
by leaving that entry blank. You can separately enable or disable PVP aspects
without needing to change your orbs by using the checkbox near the bottom.
