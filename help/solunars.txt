SOLUNARS PAGE

The Search Direction radio buttons allows you to choose:
1. Active Charts: all selected solunars active at the given date and time.
2. Forwards: the first chart of each selected solunar after the date and time.
3. Backward: the last chart of each selected solunar before the date and time.

If desired, check All Selected Solunars For One Year and all occurances of the selected charts in that year will be calculated. 
Charts will not be diaplayed. May not be combined with Active Charts.

Recent button: displays recently used location for one-click selection.

Find button: finds coordinates of typed location using a free public online database (Open Street Map).

Optional Event has two buttons:
1. New Chart button: opens a dialog to select options for this chart, uses the location, date and time fields to be
used for the calculation of the selected solunars.
2. Find Chart: opens a form which allows you to select a chart. The location, date and time of this chart will be
used for the calculation of the selected solunars.
In either case the approiate event chart will be shown when the solunars are displayed.


The Calculate button: validate the data entered on the page and either: 
   (1) Calculate, display, and save the selected charts based on the data. (No display for One Year selection.)
